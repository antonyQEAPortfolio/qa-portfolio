Test Isolation:

Playwright Test is based on the concept of test fixtures such as the built in page fixture, 
which is passed into your test. Pages are isolated between tests due to the Browser Context, 
which is equivalent to a brand new browser profile, where every test gets a fresh environment, 
even when multiple tests run in a single Browser.
