node_modules:

Description: Contains all the project dependencies installed via npm, including Playwright and any other packages specified in package.json.
Interview Tip: Mention that this folder is auto-generated and should not be modified manually. It’s typically excluded from version control using .gitignore.

playwright-report:

Description: Stores the HTML test reports generated by Playwright after test execution.
Interview Tip: Highlight that you can open index.html inside this folder to view detailed test run summaries including steps, logs, and screenshots.

test-results:

Description: Temporary folder where Playwright saves raw artifacts like screenshots, videos, and traces during test execution.
Interview Tip: Mention that this is useful for debugging failed tests and that you can replay test traces using npx playwright show-trace.

tests/
  example.spec.ts:

Description: Primary folder for your actual test scripts. By default, Playwright generates example.spec.ts here.
Interview Tip: Explain this is where you'll write and organize your own .spec.ts or .spec.js test files, often grouped by features or modules.

test-examples/
  demo-todo-app.spec.ts

.gitignore:

Description: Specifies which files and folders Git should ignore (like node_modules, playwright-report, test-results, etc.).
Interview Tip: Show awareness of best practices in source control by explaining the importance of not committing large or auto-generated folders.

package-lock.json:

Description: Automatically generated file that locks the versions of dependencies installed, ensuring consistent builds.
Interview Tip: Mention this is essential for reproducibility and debugging across environments.

package.json:

Description: Defines the project’s metadata, scripts, and dependencies (like Playwright, test runners, etc.).
Interview Tip: You can highlight how this is used to configure test scripts like npx playwright test and to manage test-related tools and libraries.

playwright.config.ts:
